Hope is the thing with feathers
that perches on the soul.
and sings the song without the words
and never stops at all.

Sweetest in the gale is heard
and sore must be the storm
that could abash the little bird
that kept so many warm.

I've heard it in the chillest land -
And on the strangest Sea -
Yet - never - in Extremity,
It asked a crumb - of me.
